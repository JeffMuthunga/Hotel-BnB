### Jeff Muthunga

This folder contains 4 major files with source code aimed at making a hotel version of Air BnB. The website can allow
**A html, js, css and db.json files**
## 1. Project Description
Hotel BnB is a website that allows users to search for and review hotels, and sellers to post their hotels to be displayed in the website. The searchbar is sensitive to Cities or Hotel names and is not case-sensitive.
The app will be useful to mostly tourists who are new and do not know the best places to stay at and for sellers to advertise their hotels.
